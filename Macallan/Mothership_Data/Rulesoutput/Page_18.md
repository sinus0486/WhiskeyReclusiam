18.2 SAVES
In order to avoid certain dangers or trauma, you 
sometimes need to roll 1d100 lower than your 
most relevant Save. This is called a Save. If 
you roll less than your Save you succeed. 
Otherwise you fail, and gain 1 Stress. A roll of 
90-99 is always a failure.
Your Saves

to withstand different kinds of trauma:
• Sanity:  Rationalize logical inconsistencies in 
the universe, make sense out of chaos, detect 
illusions and mimicry, cope with Stress.
• Fear:  Maintain a level head while struggling 
with fear, loneliness, depression, and other 
emotional surges.
• Body:  Employ quick reflexes and resist hunger, 
disease, or organisms that might try and invade 
your insides.

18.1 STAT CHECKS
Whenever you want to do something and the price 
for failure is high, roll 1d100 and attempt to roll 
lower than your most relevant Stat. This is called 
a Stat Check. If you roll less than your Stat you 
succeed. Otherwise, you fail and gain 1 Stress. 
A roll of 90-99 is always a failure.
