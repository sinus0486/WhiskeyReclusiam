Reduce your Maximum Health by 1d5.

rounds without intervention.
03-04You are comatose.  Only extraordinary measures can 
return you to the waking world.
05-09 You have died.  Roll up a new character.29.2 DEATH
If your death seems imminent, make your last 
moments count: save someone’s life, solve an 
important mystery, give the others time to escape. 
When you die, the Warden makes a Death Save  
by placing 1d10 in a cup, shaking the cup, and 
placing it face down on the table (covering the die). 
As soon as someone spends a turn checking your 
vitals, the die is revealed and the roll is looked up 
on the Death Table  below. Use common sense.

You have died.  29.1 WHAT ARE WOUNDS?
When gaining a Wound, roll 1d10 on the Wounds 
Table  according to the type of Damage:
• Blunt Force:  Getting punched, hit with a 
crowbar or a thrown object, falling, etc.
• Bleeding:  Getting stabbed or cut.
• Gunshot: Getting shot by a firearm.
• Fire & Explosives:  Grenades, flamethrowers, 
doused in fuel and lit on fire, etc.
• Gore & Massive:  Giant or gruesome attacks.
Use the Severity  column (and common 
sense) as a guide. Flesh Wounds  are small 
inconveniences. Minor/Major Injuries  
cause lasting issues which require medical 
treatment. Lethal Injuries  can kill you if not 
dealt with immediately. Fatal Injuries  can kill 
outright. Bleeding wounds, if not treated can 
quickly overwhelm you. Some attacks deal 
Wounds directly (bypassing any Armor or 
Damage Reduction).
