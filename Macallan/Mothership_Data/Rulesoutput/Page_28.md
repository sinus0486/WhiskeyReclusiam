Make a Combat Check. If successful, roll the weapon’s 
Damage and subtract it from the enemy’s Health. If 
y
ou fail, the situation gets worse and you gain 1 Stress.
Read about Stat Checks on pg. 18.
28.2 DAMAGE
When taking Damage (DMG), subtract it from 
Health. If your Health reaches zero, gain a Wound  
and roll on the Wounds Table. Then, reset the 
character’s Health to its Maximum and subtract any 
carr
yover damage. Once your character suffers their 
Maximum Wounds, make a Death Save.
Read about Death on pg. 29.2. 
28.3 ARMOR
Characters ignore all Damage less than their 
armor’s Armor Points (AP). However, if they ever 
take Damage greater than or equal to their AP in 
one hit, their ar
mor is destroyed and they suffer any 
remaining Damage. Weapons with Anti-Armor (AA)
ignore and destroy armor whenever they hit. Some 
armor may have Damage Reduction (DR) which always 
reduces incoming Damage by the amount stated (even if 
the ar
mor is destroyed, or if the weapon has Anti-Armor). 
Damage Reduction occurs first (before any Armor).
28.4 COVER
The environment can provide protection called Cover. 
It can be destroyed, just like armor, whenever it is dealt 
Damage g
reater than or equal to its AP . Cover typically 
only protects against ranged attacks, but in some 
situations may help block a hand-to-hand attack. If you 
shoot while in Cover, you are considered out of Cover 
until y
our next turn.28
