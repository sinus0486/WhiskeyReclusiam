Example: Recovery
WARDEN : Congratulations! Y ou make it back 
to port safe and sound, except for Jamie.
PHIL: Rest in peace, you son of a bitch.
WARDEN : Corporate is sending a shuttle 
for you, but it won’t be here for a couple of 
weeks. Is there anything ya’ll want to do 
while you’re waiting? This is a B-Class Port, 
so they have a decent amount of amenities.
CLEO : Y eah, I want to treat this Paranoid 
condition I’ve got. Is there somewhere I can 
go for that?
WARDEN : Let’s see, there’s a Cognitive 
Defragging clinic. It costs about 100k credits 
for a 24 hour long surgery. There is however 
a slight 1% chance of total amnesia.
CLEO : I don’t have that kind of money even if 
I was okay with losing all of my memories.
PHIL: We have that goo jar we could sell.
KNOX : What about Wounds? I’m hanging on 
by a thread here.
WARDEN : Pseudoflesh Injections run about 
500kcr a pop.
PHIL: Maybe we should just die, it would be 
cheaper.
WARDEN : Well, if you need cash quick, there’s 
a little job you could do...
No matter how careful you are, sooner or later you 
are going to get hurt. Minor injuries can usually 
be treated with a quick rest, but Wounds and 
Conditions require professional treatment.
34.1 SHORT TERM RECOVERY
Once per day, whenever resting, a character’s 
body attempts to heal itself naturally. After 6+ 
hours of rest make a Body Save. If successful, 
reset Health to its Maximum.  Wounds, however, 
remain the same.
34.2 LONG TERM RECOVERY
Recovering Wounds, Conditions, or losses to 
Stats and Saves takes a longer time. See the 
Medical Expenses table for a non-comprehensive 
list of available treatments.34
