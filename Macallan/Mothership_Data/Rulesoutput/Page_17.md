17.1 DICE NOTATION
There are three ways we notate dice:
• 1d100  means to roll a pair of ten-sided 
dice, where one die represents the tens 
digit and the other represents the ones 
digit. For example: if you roll a 90 and a 
9 that equals 99. If you roll a 00 and a 0, 
that equals a zero.
• xd10  means to roll a number of ten-sided 
dice (e.g., 1d10, 2d10) and add them 
together.
• We use a twenty-sided die (1d20) called 
the Panic Die.  You use this only to make 
Panic Checks. 
• If you see [+] next to a roll it means the roll 
has Advantage  while [-] means the roll 
has Disadvantage.
