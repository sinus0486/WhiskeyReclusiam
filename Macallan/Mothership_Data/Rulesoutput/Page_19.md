19.1 MODIFYING STAT CHECKS & SAVES

There are three things that can modify the outcome of a Stat Check 
or Save: Advantage & Disadvantage,  Critical Successes & 
Failures,  and Skills.

## Advantage & Disadvantage
Whenever you are making a roll of any kind (Stat Check, Save, 
Panic Check, Damage, etc.) and the character has a situational 
advantage (like assistance from someone else), roll twice and 
take the best result. When at a situational disadvantage (like 
poor weather or bad visibility), roll twice and take the worst result. 

Advantage is notated with [+], Disadvantage with [-] (e.g., Body 
Save [+] means make a Body Save with Advantage). If a character 
has both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel each other out.

## Critical Successes & Failures
Whenever you roll doubles (e.g., 00, 66) on a Stat Check or 
Save, you have rolled a Critical.  If the roll is a success, it is now 
a Critical Success  and something very good happens. If it is a 
failure, it is now a Critical Failure  and something bad happens, and 
furthermore you must make a Panic Check.  A roll of 00 is always a 
Critical Success and a roll of 99 is always a Critical Failure.
Read more about Panic Checks on pg. 21.

## Skills
If a character has a Skill that is relevant to the task at hand, you 
can add the Skillâ€™s bonus to the Stat or Save before making your roll 
(giving you a higher number to roll under).
