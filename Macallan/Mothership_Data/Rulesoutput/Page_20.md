The unknown horrors of the cosmos and the vast 
emptiness of space take a toll on a person. Stress  
is a measure of that toll, and how it subtly affects 
you, bringing you closer to the brink of Panic.  
While Stress by itself doesn’t do anything, the 
higher your Stress is, the more likely you are 
to Panic , and the more Stress you have when you 
Panic, the worse your Panic is likely to be.

## 20.1 HOW DO I GAIN STRESS?
You gain 1 Stress every time you fail a Stat 
Check or Save. Occasionally, certain locations 
or entities can automatically give you Stress from 
interacting with or witnessing them. Y our Minimum 
Stress  starts at 2, and based on events that 
happen in game, such as certain Panic Check 
results, it can be increased or decreased. The 
maximum Stress you can have is 20. Any 
Stress you take over 20 instead reduces the most 
relevant Stat or Save by that amount.

## 20.2 HOW DO I RELIEVE STRESS?
Y ou can relieve Stress by resting  in a relatively 
safe place. To do this, make a Rest Save using 
your worst Save.  If you succeed, reduce your 
Stress by the ones digit rolled (e.g., if you rolled 
24 under your worst Save of 30, reduce your 
Stress by 4). If you fail, you gain 1 Stress instead. 
Players can gain Advantage on their Rest Save by 
participating in consensual sex, recreational drug 
use, a night of heavy drinking, prayer, or any other 
suitable leisure activity. Unsafe locations may incur 
Disadvantage on Rest Saves at the Warden’s 
discretion. Stress is typically not relieved during 
cryosleep. Finally, if you have more time, you can 
take Shore Leave  and convert your Stress into 
improved Saves.
