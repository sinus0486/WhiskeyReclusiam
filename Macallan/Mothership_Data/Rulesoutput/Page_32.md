32.4 EXHAUSTION
Long grueling treks on undiscovered planets 
can easily grind you down. If it becomes relevant, 
track exhaustion by making a Body Save every 
hour after 12 hours of activity. On failure gain 1 
Stress and take 1 Damage. After 24 hours of 
exhaustion, roll at Disadvantage on all rolls 
until the character can rest for 8 hours.
32.5 FOOD & WATER
Humans can survive roughly 3 weeks without 
food. After 24 hours without food, roll at 
Disadvantage to all rolls.
For the bare minimum of 
survival you need 1 liter 
of water a day. However, 
at this level, any 
strenuous activity 
(e.g., running, combat, 
making mechanical 
repairs) forces you to 
make a Body Save or 
pass out. When water 
is scarce and you’re 
tracking it this closely, 
you’re at Disadvantage 
on all rolls.Below are some of the most common afflictions 
characters may encounter while exploring space.
32.1 ATMOSPHERES
Planets with Toxic or Corrosive atmospheres 
require special gear to explore, otherwise there is 
the risk of harm or even death. 
Toxic Atmosphere
The planet’s atmosphere is not fit to breathe, but 
is otherwise safe. A rebreather or armor with its 
own oxygen supply is required. Without these, 
characters take 1d10 DMG per round, Body 
Save for half.
Corrosive Atmosphere
The planet’s atmosphere is deadly and destructive. 
It deals Damage every round while on it. This 
ranges from 1 DMG / round (Mildly Corrosive) 
to 10 DMG / round (Highly Corrosive).  Anything 
higher is simply impossible to safely traverse 
without specialized equipment and armor. 
32.2 BLEEDING
Some weapons or Wounds cause characters to 
Bleed.  This means they take 1 Damage every 
round until the bleeding is stopped.  This is 
cumulative. If a character is bleeding 1 Damage 
per round and gains Bleeding +1,  they now take 
2 Damage per round. Bleeding damage ignores 
armor and damage reduction.

32.3 CRYOSICKNESS
To endure long space journeys or hyperspace 
jumps, crews use cryopods, which are coffin-
like capsules that freeze them in a suspended 
animation called cryosleep. While in cryosleep, 
vitals are preserved and aging slows down. 
However, upon awakening, you experience a 
hangover-like feeling called cryosickness, which 
causes sluggishness and slow reflexes. While 
cryosick you suffer [-] on all rolls for 1 week.  
Upgraded cryochambers can help mitigate these 
effects, and a stimpak can cure them instantly.
