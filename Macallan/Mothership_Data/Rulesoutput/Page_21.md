Panic Checks & Agency
Be sure to go over the Panic Table and 
remove any results that don’t fit with your 
group. Remember: roleplaying Panic is 
not an excuse to make someone else 
uncomfortable. As usual, check in regularly.Stress, Damage, and emotional wear and tear 
eventually bring characters to their breaking point. 
When that happens, there’s a chance they Panic. 
Y ou determine this by making a Panic Check.

21.1 WHAT IS A PANIC CHECK?
A Panic Check determines whether the character 
can keep their cool under extreme pressure. 
To make a Panic Check, roll the Panic Die  (1d20) 
and attempt to roll greater than your current 
Stress.  If you roll less than or equal to your 
current Stress you fail, and you look up your result 
on the Panic Table.

21.2 WHEN TO MAKE PANIC CHECKS
You must make a Panic Check anytime you 
roll a Critical Failure on a Stat Check or Save. 
Additionally, the Warden may call for a Panic 
Check at any other appropriate time, including, but 
not limited to:
• Watching another crewmember die.
• Witnessing more than 1 crewmember Panic at 
the same time.
• Whenever your Ship rolls a Critical Failure, 
everyone on board makes a Panic Check.
• Encountering a strange and horrifying entity for 
the first time.
• When all hope is lost and death feels certain.
• Whenever you, the player, want.

21.3 CONDITIONS
Some results of the Panic Table are so severe that 
they leave a lasting impression on you. These are 
called Conditions , and they affect you until you 
are able to treat them.
