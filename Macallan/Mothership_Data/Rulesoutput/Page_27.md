Example: The Thing That Was Phil
WARDEN:  Okay, so the thing that used to 
be Phil is galloping down the corridor. His 
mouth is unzipping down his chest, into one 
giant maw. Cleo, it’s reaching out to grab you 
and Knox, and unimpeded it’s going to crash 
right into you. What are y’all doing?
CLEO:  I’m gonna stand my ground and 
unload on this guy. Sorry, Phil. 
PHIL: It was my fault. I shouldn’t have opened 
that door. 
WARDEN:  Cleo, make a Combat Check. 
There’s a lot of pipes here, so you might take 
some blowback Damage if you fail.
CLEO:  That’s fine, I hate this ship anyway. I 
can add my Military Training?
WARDEN:  Definitely. Phil, I think it’s safe to 
say you can roll up another character or play 
one of the marines you hired at that last port. 
PHIL: Oh yeah, I’ll play Cpl. Davis, I liked her. 
WARDEN:  Perfect. She’s still on the bridge, 
but if she heads this way she can be here 
next round. Knox, what about you?
KNOX:  I think I’m just gonna try and get to 
some cover. I want to get out of the  
Being-Formerly-Known-as-Phil’s way. 
WARDEN:  Ex-Phil is running pretty fast, so 
that’ll be a Speed Check. Failure means 
it’ll be able to get you. Does all of this 
sound good to everyone?
KNOX:  My body is ready. 
WARDEN:  Okay, sweet. Let’s roll. 
CLEO:  Fail. 
KNOX:  Fail. 
PHIL: Y’all. 
WARDEN:  Okay, so, Cleo, you fire but the 
creature is moving too fast. Y ou hit the pipes 
embedded in the bulkhead, and they spray 
steam right into your eyes. Take 4 Damage. 
CLEO:  Dammit!
WARDEN:  Knox, the Phil-Thing snatches you 
up, and its claws just tear through you. Y ou 
take... ouch. 14 Damage—
KNOX:  That’s a Wound for sure. 
WARDEN:  Alright, Cpl. Davis, you arrive and 
you’re seeing this carnage. Y our former 
character is about to devour Knox alive. 
What’s everyone doing? Oh, and Knox, let’s 
roll up that Wound.
KNOX:  Wonderful.
Being Effective in a Fight
Y our Combat Stat isn’t the only thing that 
matters when it comes to fighting for your 
life. Distract enemies while your fellow 
crewmembers take aim. Study the creature’s 
movement to see if you can spot a pattern or 
weakness. Bandage bleeding wounds. Run 
away (always a good idea). Hide. In short, 
treat every round like a completely unique 
situation, and try not to look at your character 
sheet too much. Outsmart, outrun, and 
outlast your enemy. That’s all that matters.27.1 WHAT CAN I DO?
Characters can generally move somewhere within 
Close Range  and then do one thing before the 
situation changes.
Think of the situation like a real life scenario. Think 
about what you would do in those circumstances, 
then describe that to the Warden. If you can’t 
accomplish everything you want to do in one 
round, or your choices are especially foolhardy or 
dangerous, the Warden will do their best to let you 
know and explain the risks involved. 
Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the kinds of things 
you could attempt in a round:
• Attack something or someone.
• Bandage a wound to try and stop the bleeding.
• Check vital signs with a medscanner.
• Move again.
• Fire a vehicle’s weapon.
• Maneuver or pilot a vehicle.
• Open an airlock.
• Operate a machine.
• Reload a weapon.
• Throw something at or to someone.
• Use a computer terminal (to search a directory, 
engage automatic airlocks, send a distress 
signal, cycle through CCTV cameras, disable 
Life Support, etc.).
Additionally, if you decide to do nothing other 
than run, you can move somewhere within Long 
Range during the round.
