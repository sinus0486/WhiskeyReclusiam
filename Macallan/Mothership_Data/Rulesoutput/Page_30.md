WARDEN:  Alright, so the 
airlock door breaks down 
and more of these Phils 
start swarming the base.
KNOX:  I’m running. Just 
pure running, non-stop.
Cleo: I’m going to lob a 
grenade before running.
WARDEN:  It’s within Close 
Range. Y ou’re throwing it or 
just dropping it?
CLEO:  Just dropping.
WARDEN:  In that case it 
makes sense to give them 
an Instinct Save to avoid.IT CAN TOUCH YOU
30.1 ADJACENT
Y ou’re basically touching. This 
covers fist fights, close-quarters 
combat, and trying to get out of 
the grips of a hideous terror’s 
claws. More than that, it covers 
things like using a computer 
terminal or administering first 
aid to someone. Y ou can talk 
comfortably, whisper, and even 
smell someone at this range.Range, distance, and movement 
are tracked abstractly in Range 
Bands . These are:
• Adjacent
• Close Range
• Long Range
• Extreme Range
Describing distance should be 
done in human casual terms. 
What’s important is whether 
someone can touch you, 
whether they can get to you, 
whether you can shoot them, or 
whether you can’t.30
