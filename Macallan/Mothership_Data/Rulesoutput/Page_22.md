54 and 77. Fuck. Critical fail.22.1 NO SKILL (+0)
Just because you don’t have a Skill doesn’t mean 
you don’t know anything about the subject, and 
it usually doesn’t mean you can’t at least make 
an attempt. What it means is that you don’t have 
significant enough experience or expertise in the 
matter to act decisively in high pressure situations. 
Therefore, you get no bonus, and depending 
on how complex the task is, you might roll with 
Disadvantage (or not be able to attempt it at all).
Read more about Disadvantage on pg. 19.1.Skills  represent the accumulated knowledge, craft, 
techniques, and training a character possesses in 
a certain field. Whenever you make a Stat Check 
or Save and you have a relevant Skill, you add 
your Skill Bonus  to your Stat or Save, giving you 
a higher number to roll under. 
Each class starts with a few Skills, and characters 
can acquire more through long-term study and 
rigorous Skill Training.
