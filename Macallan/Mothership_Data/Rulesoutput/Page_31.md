31.3 EXTREME RANGE
Only the longest range 
weapons, like smart rifles, can 
hit something accurately in this 
band. It takes more than one 
turn to get to something here, 
and even if you hear a scream 
you might not know which 
direction it’s coming from.YOU CAN SHOOT IT
31.2 LONG RANGE
Things in this band are far 
enough away that they take an 
entire round or longer to get to. 
Rifles are effective at this range, 
but handguns and shotguns 
less so. Y ou’d have to yell at 
someone to get their attention, 
and you probably won’t smell 
anyone at Long Range, no 
matter how bad they stink.IT CAN GET TO YOU
31.1 CLOSE RANGE
Someone Close can be reached 
by running over to them in a 
few seconds. They’re near 
enough that you could likely 
throw something at them and 
hit them. Y ou’d have to speak 
loud enough that someone on 
the other side of the room could 
hear you. Powerful stenches 
can be smelled if they’re Close. 
Firearms like shotguns are 
most effective at this range or
