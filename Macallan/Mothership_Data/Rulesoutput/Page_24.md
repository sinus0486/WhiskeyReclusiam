Example: Skill Training
WARDEN:  Okay, so after some paper shuffling 
and some mandatory safety training, the 
Company is putting you back to work hauling 
cargo from one end of the galaxy to another. 
KNOX:  Oh, thank god. I never thought I’d be 
so grateful to go back to my job...
WARDEN:  Exactly. Is there anything you all 
want to do in your off-time?
CLEO:  I’m just training my Robotics Skill. I still 
have, ugh, forty-two months left to go.
KNOX : I think my guy actually wants to get out 
of the Company life and get into the action 
more. Is there any way for him to like, take 
Military Training?
WARDEN : Y eah definitely, but it’s a six year 
contract, so you’d essentially roll up a new 
character and put the other one aside until 
time catches up and he gets out. Plus, he 
could die. Is that something you’re into?
KNOX : Oh, yeah, that sounds great actually.
WARDEN : Any of you can do that, by the way. 
Like, park a character for some time and roll 
someone else up. Just give me a heads up 
so I have time to prep something for the new 
characters.
CLEO : Oooh, that sounds fun!
WARDEN : For sure. Okay, Knox, your guy 
finds a recruiter at a nearby station and 
enlists. For everyone else, six months go by, 
so you can mark that on your sheets.24.1 TRAIN A SKILL
To learn a new Skill you need to spend the 
requisite amount of time and credits.
• Trained Skills:  2 years + 10kcr in materials.
• Expert Skills:  4 years + 50kcr in materials.
• Master Skills:  6 years + 200kcr in materials.
To train an Expert Skill requires one Trained Skill 
prerequisite and to train a Master Skill requires 
one Expert Skill prerequisite.
Why does it take so long?
Skill Training assumes characters are working full 
time, going on missions, and generally living life. 
If studying full-time (e.g., by going to school), 
then training takes half as long.  Y our Warden 
may allow additional resources (private tutoring, 
AI assistance, cybermods, slickware, etc.) to 
decrease the time required.24
