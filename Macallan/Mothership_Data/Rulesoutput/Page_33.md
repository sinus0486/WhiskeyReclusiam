RADIATION
LEVEL DAMAGE
LEVEL 1 - TRACE  
Normal, everyday radiation, 
cosmic rays.None immediately. Possible long-
term side effects (cancer, etc.).
LEVEL 2 - ACUTE  
Unshielded reactors/Warp Cores.Reduce all Stats and Saves by 1 
every round.
LEVEL 3 - LETHAL  
Atomic weapons, direct handling 
of Warp Cores.Every round: Body Save or lethal 
dose (death in 1d5 days).33.2 RADIATION
Whether it’s cosmic rays, an engine leak, or some 
previously undiscovered asteroid ore, radiation 
can kill you if you’re not careful.
Armor with Radiation Shielding  (e.g., the Hazard 
Suit) blocks all three levels of radiation.
Read about Armor on pg. 14-15  and pg. 28.3.
33.3 STIMPAK OVERDOSE
Excessive use of stimpaks (and other dangerous 
drugs) carries a risk of overdose. Whenever a 
character takes more than one stimpak in a day, 
roll 1d10. If you roll under the amount of doses 
taken in the past 24 hours, make a Death Save. 
Read more about Death Saves on pg. 29.2
33.4 TEMPERATURE
In most cases, a hot climate or a cold climate has 
no notable effects. However, in places of extreme 
cold or heat, you should make Body Saves every 
hour or succumb to the Extreme Cold/Heat.
Extreme Cold
In sub-zero temperatures hypothermia and 
frostbite can set in within 10-30 min for those 
not dressed appropriately. To survive you must 
bring your body up to its normal temperature. 
Hypothermia can kill within 30 min to 6 hours.
Extreme Heat
Extreme heat over 100ºF/40ºC can cause heat 
stroke and kill within hours. Victims must move 
to a cooler location immediately to get their 
temperature down.33.1 OXYGEN
In space you can last 15 seconds without oxygen 
before falling unconscious. After passing out, you 
can survive for 1d5 minutes before dying.
If all of a ship’s Life Support System goes offline, 
roll 1d10 and multiply it by the maximum crew 
capacity. This is the remaining oxygen supply.
Every 24 hours, subtract the total number of 
breathing crewmembers from the remaining 
oxygen supply.  Any crewmembers engaging 
in strenuous activity (e.g., running, combat, 
mechanical repairs, etc.) further reduce the 
oxygen supply by 2 each.
Whenever the oxygen supply is less 
than twice the amount of breathing 
passengers,  all rolls are at 
Disadvantage as the crew suffers 
headaches, fatigue, anxiety, and 
general clumsiness.
Whenever the oxygen supply 
is less than the total amount 
of breathing passengers,  every 
breathing passenger must 
make a Body Save or 
else make a Death Save 
(pg. 29.2) as they suffer 
panting, dizziness, severe 
headaches, impaired vision 
and tinnitus.
Once the oxygen supply 
runs out,  you can survive 
for 15 seconds before you 
fall unconscious. After 
falling unconscious,  
you can survive for 
1d5 minutes without 
oxygen before dying.
Androids do not 
consume oxygen from 
the oxygen supply
Those in cryosleep do not 
reduce the Oxygen supply.33
