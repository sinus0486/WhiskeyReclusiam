Strict Turn Order
Some groups prefer a very strict turn 
order. If this is the case for your group, 
we recommend everyone make a Speed 
Check at the start of the encounter. Those 
who succeed go before the enemy hostiles, 
and those who fail go after. If the situation 
changes dramatically (e.g., if new hostiles 
enter the encounter), Speed Checks can be 
called for again.Violence in Mothership is incredibly dangerous, 
and should be avoided at all costs. When all else 
fails, this is how to resolve the encounter.
26.1 TURN ORDER
During a violent confrontation, time is split into 
roughly 10 second intervals called rounds.  
Everything within a round happens at basically the 
same time.
The Warden describes the situation and what is 
likely to happen if no response,  then play goes 
around the table and each player describes how 
their characters react. As usual, feel free to ask 
questions, and the Warden answers and explains 
the likely consequences of failure. 
Once you understand the stakes and what you 
want to do, you commit to a course of action, 
either individually or as a group. Once everyone 
has done this, the Warden resolves everyoneâ€™s 
actions at once, assigning any necessary Stat 
Checks or Saves. Then everyone who has to, rolls.
After any Stat Checks and Saves are rolled, if 
anyone is taking Damage or a Wound, those are 
rolled. Finally, the Warden describes the new 
situation, and the next round starts. This repeats 
until the encounter is resolved.
26.2 SURPRISE
If there is a chance that characters are ambushed 
or stunned by a horrific encounter, the Warden 
calls for a Fear Save. Those who succeed are able 
to react, those who fail are too shocked to react 
until the next round.26
