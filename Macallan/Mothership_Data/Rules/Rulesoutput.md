17.1 DICE NOTATION
There are three ways we notate dice:
• 1d100  means to roll a pair of ten-sided 
dice, where one die represents the tens 
digit and the other represents the ones 
digit. For example: if you roll a 90 and a 
9 that equals 99. If you roll a 00 and a 0, 
that equals a zero.
• xd10  means to roll a number of ten-sided 
dice (e.g., 1d10, 2d10) and add them 
together.
• We use a twenty-sided die (1d20) called 
the Panic Die.  Y ou use this only to make 
Panic Checks. 
• If you see [+] next to a roll it means the roll 
has Advantage  while [-] means the roll 
has Disadvantage.
Read more about Advantage & 
Disadvantage on pg. 19.1.With these basics in mind, you’re ready to handle 
90% of the situations that come up in a game. For 
everything else, you, the Warden, and the other 
players will discuss the situation and come up with 
a House Rule  to suit the table’s specific needs.
With that being said, you can close this book and 
start playing right now! There’s even a handy 
cheat sheet on the back cover if you forget 
something. If you’d like a little more information 
about how it all works, read on.Mothership® is a tabletop roleplaying game. Y ou 
and your friends get together, and one of you, the 
Warden,  prepares a scenario for the rest of you to 
explore and interact with. Y ou ask questions, roll 
some dice, make some jokes, and die a few times. 
The rules are simple, but the game is challenging:
• You can attempt to do anything you want, 
and are not limited by what is on your character 
sheet. Most things you want to do just happen.
• You should ask a lot of questions. The more 
information you have, the less likely you’ll have 
to make risky rolls like Stat Checks  and Saves.
• Stat Checks are made when you want to do 
something and the price for failure is high.
• Saves  are reactions, rolled to avoid different 
mental, emotional, and physical dangers .
Read more about Stat Checks & Saves on pg. 18.
• When you fail a Stat Check or a Save your 
character gains 1 or more Stress.  Stress can 
be bad, as it makes characters more likely to 
Panic, but is also needed to improve Saves.
• Panic Checks  are rolled when the worst has 
happened and your character snaps. A bad 
result can lead to a long-term Condition  that 
needs treatment, but a good result can provide 
focus when it is needed the most.
Read more about Stress & Panic on pg. 20-21.
• When characters get hurt they lose Health . If 
they lose enough Health they suffer a Wound . 
If they gain Wounds equal to their maximum 
they die.
Read more about Violent Encounters on pg. 26.17
HOW TO PLAY
18.3 WHAT IS YOUR HIGH SCORE?
High Score  is a record of the number of sessions your character has survived. It doesn’t affect 
gameplay at all, it’s just a fun number to track. Y our Warden may have other ideas on how to use it 
in game (like as a Reputation stat, or as a spendable luck resource). Don’t stress about your High 
Score too much—the average High Score of a character is about 4. Just focus on staying alive and 
you’ll beat that in no time.18.2 SAVES
In order to avoid certain dangers or trauma, you 
sometimes need to roll 1d100 lower than your 
most relevant Save. This is called a Save. If 
you roll less than your Save you succeed. 
Otherwise you fail, and gain 1 Stress. A roll of 
90-99 is always a failure.
Your Saves
Y ou have three Saves which represent your ability 
to withstand different kinds of trauma:
• Sanity:  Rationalize logical inconsistencies in 
the universe, make sense out of chaos, detect 
illusions and mimicry, cope with Stress.
• Fear:  Maintain a level head while struggling 
with fear, loneliness, depression, and other 
emotional surges.
• Body:  Employ quick reflexes and resist hunger, 
disease, or organisms that might try and invade 
your insides.18.1 STAT CHECKS
Whenever you want to do something and the price 
for failure is high, roll 1d100 and attempt to roll 
lower than your most relevant Stat. This is called 
a Stat Check. If you roll less than your Stat you 
succeed. Otherwise, you fail and gain 1 Stress. 
A roll of 90-99 is always a failure.
Your Stats
Y ou have four main Stats which represent your 
abilities when acting under extreme pressure: 
• Strength:  Holding airlocks closed, carrying 
fallen comrades, climbing, pushing, jumping.
• Speed:  Getting out of the cargo bay before the 
blast doors close, acting before someone (or 
something) else, running away.
• Intellect:  Recalling your training and 
experience under duress, thinking through 
difficult problems, inventing or fixing things.
• Combat:  Fighting for your life.18
STAT CHECKS & SAVES
Calling for a Check
WARDEN: Okay, so you hear 
that screeching sound 
coming from down the 
corridor, what do you do?
CLEO:  Can I open up the 
airlock door quietly and 
try and sneak out before it 
notices me?
WARDEN:  It’s jammed 
up pretty bad right now. 
Y ou’ll need to make a 
Strength Check. Failure 
risks making a lot of noise 
and drawing the creature’s 
attention.
CLEO:  I’ve got the Industrial 
Equipment  Skill and a 
crowbar, does that help?
WARDEN:  Definitely! Y ou 
can add your Skill’s bonus, 
and the crowbar will give 
you Advantage on your roll.
CLEO:  Okay, I’m going for 
it! I’ve got a 35 Strength, 
plus 10 from Industrial 
Equipment. So anything 
under 45, right? 
WARDEN:  That’s right.
CLEO:  66... and... 43... 
Phew! Just made it.19.1 MODIFYING STAT CHECKS & SAVES
There are three things that can modify the outcome of a Stat Check 
or Save: Advantage & Disadvantage,  Critical Successes & 
Failures,  and Skills.
Advantage & Disadvantage
Whenever you are making a roll of any kind (Stat Check, Save, 
Panic Check, Damage, etc.) and the character has a situational 
advantage (like assistance from someone else), roll twice and 
take the best result. When at a situational disadvantage (like 
poor weather or bad visibility), roll twice and take the worst result. 
Advantage is notated with [+], Disadvantage with [-] (e.g., Body 
Save [+] means make a Body Save with Advantage). If a character 
has both Advantage and Disadvantage, they cancel each other out.
Critical Successes & Failures
Whenever you roll doubles (e.g., 00, 66) on a Stat Check or 
Save, you have rolled a Critical.  If the roll is a success, it is now 
a Critical Success  and something very good happens. If it is a 
failure, it is now a Critical Failure  and something bad happens, and 
furthermore you must make a Panic Check.  A roll of 00 is always a 
Critical Success and a roll of 99 is always a Critical Failure.
Read more about Panic Checks on pg. 21.
Skills
If a character has a Skill that is relevant to the task at hand, you 
can add the Skill’s bonus to the Stat or Save before making your roll 
(giving you a higher number to roll under).
Read more about Skills on pg. 22.19
MODIFYING STAT CHECKS & SAVES
Example: Back at the Barracks
WARDEN:  Alright, you finally make it back to 
the ship and lock yourselves in. Y ou can rest 
now if you want.
KNOX:  I’ve got 12 Stress, so my boy is going 
to rest. He can’t go on like this.
WARDEN:  No problem. The barracks is pretty 
spartan, but not too bad, so just roll whatever 
your worst Save is.
KNOX:  Cleo, you have Psychology, right? Any 
chance you’d be willing to like, talk to my guy 
and calm him down a bit?
CLEO:  I’ve only got 3 Stress, so I’m down.
WARDEN:  If you’re willing to give up your rest, 
I’ll give Knox Advantage on his Rest Save.
CLEO:  Let’s do it.
WARDEN:  Perfect, so you’re like, venting 
about all this to Cleo, and Cleo, you’re just 
talking him through it?
CLEO:  Getting him not to spiral, yeah.
WARDEN:  Okay, go ahead and roll.
KNOX:  My worst Save is Sanity at 14. So I get 
a 22 and a 56. So that would be a Crit Fail, 
but with Advantage it’s just a normal fail.
CLEO:  Jesus, that could’ve been bad.
WARDEN:  So yeah, sounds like talking it out 
actually made it worse. Gain 1 Stress.
CLEO:  I just texted people while he talked.
Sex
Get everyone at the table’s consent before 
dealing with sex in your game. Set clear 
boundaries for what is acceptable, and 
check in regularly in case anything changes.The unknown horrors of the cosmos and the vast 
emptiness of space take a toll on a person. Stress  
is a measure of that toll, and how it subtly affects 
you, bringing you closer to the brink of Panic.  
While Stress by itself doesn’t do anything, the 
higher your Stress is, the more likely you are 
to Panic , and the more Stress you have when you 
Panic, the worse your Panic is likely to be.
20.1 HOW DO I GAIN STRESS?
You gain 1 Stress every time you fail a Stat 
Check or Save. Occasionally, certain locations 
or entities can automatically give you Stress from 
interacting with or witnessing them. Y our Minimum 
Stress  starts at 2, and based on events that 
happen in game, such as certain Panic Check 
results, it can be increased or decreased. The 
maximum Stress you can have is 20. Any 
Stress you take over 20 instead reduces the most 
relevant Stat or Save by that amount.
20.2 HOW DO I RELIEVE STRESS?
Y ou can relieve Stress by resting  in a relatively 
safe place. To do this, make a Rest Save using 
your worst Save.  If you succeed, reduce your 
Stress by the ones digit rolled (e.g., if you rolled 
24 under your worst Save of 30, reduce your 
Stress by 4). If you fail, you gain 1 Stress instead. 
Players can gain Advantage on their Rest Save by 
participating in consensual sex, recreational drug 
use, a night of heavy drinking, prayer, or any other 
suitable leisure activity. Unsafe locations may incur 
Disadvantage on Rest Saves at the Warden’s 
discretion. Stress is typically not relieved during 
cryosleep. Finally, if you have more time, you can 
take Shore Leave  and convert your Stress into 
improved Saves.

Panic Checks & Agency
Be sure to go over the Panic Table and 
remove any results that don’t fit with your 
group. Remember: roleplaying Panic is 
not an excuse to make someone else 
uncomfortable. As usual, check in regularly.Stress, Damage, and emotional wear and tear 
eventually bring characters to their breaking point. 
When that happens, there’s a chance they Panic. 
Y ou determine this by making a Panic Check.
21.1 WHAT IS A PANIC CHECK?
A Panic Check determines whether the character 
can keep their cool under extreme pressure. 
To make a Panic Check, roll the Panic Die  (1d20) 
and attempt to roll greater than your current 
Stress.  If you roll less than or equal to your 
current Stress you fail, and you look up your result 
on the Panic Table. 
21.2 WHEN TO MAKE PANIC CHECKS
Y ou must make a Panic Check anytime you 
roll a Critical Failure on a Stat Check or Save. 
Additionally, the Warden may call for a Panic 
Check at any other appropriate time, including, but 
not limited to:
• Watching another crewmember die.
• Witnessing more than 1 crewmember Panic at 
the same time.
• Whenever your Ship rolls a Critical Failure, 
everyone on board makes a Panic Check.
• Encountering a strange and horrifying entity for 
the first time.
• When all hope is lost and death feels certain.
• Whenever you, the player, want.
21.3 CONDITIONS
Some results of the Panic Table are so severe that 
they leave a lasting impression on you. These are 
called Conditions , and they affect you until you 
are able to treat them.

comms and see a flare out of the corner of 
your eye.
PHIL: Uh, we’ve got a problem out here. Are 
you guys seeing anything?
CLEO:  Are we seeing anything?
WARDEN: Y our scanners start blaring and you 
get a warning of a meteor shower impacting 
in ten seconds.
PHIL: Shit, I’m running.
WARDEN:  Y ou’re in magboots so it’s slow 
going, especially in the vaccsuit. Y ou can 
make a Speed Check at Disadvantage.
PHIL: I’ve got Zero-G, would that help?
WARDEN:  Absolutely, you can add ten to your 
stat.
PHIL: My Speed is 36. Plus ten is 46. I roll a... 
54 and 77. Fuck. Critical fail.22.1 NO SKILL (+0)
Just because you don’t have a Skill doesn’t mean 
you don’t know anything about the subject, and 
it usually doesn’t mean you can’t at least make 
an attempt. What it means is that you don’t have 
significant enough experience or expertise in the 
matter to act decisively in high pressure situations. 
Therefore, you get no bonus, and depending 
on how complex the task is, you might roll with 
Disadvantage (or not be able to attempt it at all).
Read more about Disadvantage on pg. 19.1.Skills  represent the accumulated knowledge, craft, 
techniques, and training a character possesses in 
a certain field. Whenever you make a Stat Check 
or Save and you have a relevant Skill, you add 
your Skill Bonus  to your Stat or Save, giving you 
a higher number to roll under. 
Each class starts with a few Skills, and characters 
can acquire more through long-term study and 
rigorous Skill Training.

SKILLS
Example: Skill Training
WARDEN:  Okay, so after some paper shuffling 
and some mandatory safety training, the 
Company is putting you back to work hauling 
cargo from one end of the galaxy to another. 
KNOX:  Oh, thank god. I never thought I’d be 
so grateful to go back to my job...
WARDEN:  Exactly. Is there anything you all 
want to do in your off-time?
CLEO:  I’m just training my Robotics Skill. I still 
have, ugh, forty-two months left to go.
KNOX : I think my guy actually wants to get out 
of the Company life and get into the action 
more. Is there any way for him to like, take 
Military Training?
WARDEN : Y eah definitely, but it’s a six year 
contract, so you’d essentially roll up a new 
character and put the other one aside until 
time catches up and he gets out. Plus, he 
could die. Is that something you’re into?
KNOX : Oh, yeah, that sounds great actually.
WARDEN : Any of you can do that, by the way. 
Like, park a character for some time and roll 
someone else up. Just give me a heads up 
so I have time to prep something for the new 
characters.
CLEO : Oooh, that sounds fun!
WARDEN : For sure. Okay, Knox, your guy 
finds a recruiter at a nearby station and 
enlists. For everyone else, six months go by, 
so you can mark that on your sheets.24.1 TRAIN A SKILL
To learn a new Skill you need to spend the 
requisite amount of time and credits.
• Trained Skills:  2 years + 10kcr in materials.
• Expert Skills:  4 years + 50kcr in materials.
• Master Skills:  6 years + 200kcr in materials.
To train an Expert Skill requires one Trained Skill 
prerequisite and to train a Master Skill requires 
one Expert Skill prerequisite.
Why does it take so long?
Skill Training assumes characters are working full 
time, going on missions, and generally living life. 
If studying full-time (e.g., by going to school), 
then training takes half as long.  Y our Warden 
may allow additional resources (private tutoring, 
AI assistance, cybermods, slickware, etc.) to 
decrease the time required.24
SKILL TRAINING
25.1 MILITARY TRAINING
Military Training is a special exception to the 
regular rules of Skill Training for two reasons. 
First, it is free. Second, characters must 
sign a 6 year contract with the local Colonial 
Marine regiment. To find out what happened 
during their service, make a Combat Check:
• Success:  Gain Military Training, Athletics,  
and 2 Trained Skills. Gain +10 Combat, 
and reduce another Stat by 10. Gain the 
Marine’s Trauma Response.
• Critical Success:  as Success, but you 
may take an Expert Skill instead of the  
2 Trained Skills.
• Failure:  Gain Military Training, Athletics,  
and 1 Trained Skill, and the Marine’s 
Trauma Response.
• Critical Failure: Y ou were killed in action.25
SKILL TRAINING
Strict Turn Order
Some groups prefer a very strict turn 
order. If this is the case for your group, 
we recommend everyone make a Speed 
Check at the start of the encounter. Those 
who succeed go before the enemy hostiles, 
and those who fail go after. If the situation 
changes dramatically (e.g., if new hostiles 
enter the encounter), Speed Checks can be 
called for again.Violence in Mothership is incredibly dangerous, 
and should be avoided at all costs. When all else 
fails, this is how to resolve the encounter.
26.1 TURN ORDER
During a violent confrontation, time is split into 
roughly 10 second intervals called rounds.  
Everything within a round happens at basically the 
same time.
The Warden describes the situation and what is 
likely to happen if no response,  then play goes 
around the table and each player describes how 
their characters react. As usual, feel free to ask 
questions, and the Warden answers and explains 
the likely consequences of failure. 
Once you understand the stakes and what you 
want to do, you commit to a course of action, 
either individually or as a group. Once everyone 
has done this, the Warden resolves everyone’s 
actions at once, assigning any necessary Stat 
Checks or Saves. Then everyone who has to, rolls.
After any Stat Checks and Saves are rolled, if 
anyone is taking Damage or a Wound, those are 
rolled. Finally, the Warden describes the new 
situation, and the next round starts. This repeats 
until the encounter is resolved.
26.2 SURPRISE
If there is a chance that characters are ambushed 
or stunned by a horrific encounter, the Warden 
calls for a Fear Save. Those who succeed are able 
to react, those who fail are too shocked to react 
until the next round.26
VIOLENT ENCOUNTERS
Example: The Thing That Was Phil
WARDEN:  Okay, so the thing that used to 
be Phil is galloping down the corridor. His 
mouth is unzipping down his chest, into one 
giant maw. Cleo, it’s reaching out to grab you 
and Knox, and unimpeded it’s going to crash 
right into you. What are y’all doing?
CLEO:  I’m gonna stand my ground and 
unload on this guy. Sorry, Phil. 
PHIL: It was my fault. I shouldn’t have opened 
that door. 
WARDEN:  Cleo, make a Combat Check. 
There’s a lot of pipes here, so you might take 
some blowback Damage if you fail.
CLEO:  That’s fine, I hate this ship anyway. I 
can add my Military Training?
WARDEN:  Definitely. Phil, I think it’s safe to 
say you can roll up another character or play 
one of the marines you hired at that last port. 
PHIL: Oh yeah, I’ll play Cpl. Davis, I liked her. 
WARDEN:  Perfect. She’s still on the bridge, 
but if she heads this way she can be here 
next round. Knox, what about you?
KNOX:  I think I’m just gonna try and get to 
some cover. I want to get out of the  
Being-Formerly-Known-as-Phil’s way. 
WARDEN:  Ex-Phil is running pretty fast, so 
that’ll be a Speed Check. Failure means 
it’ll be able to get you. Does all of this 
sound good to everyone?
KNOX:  My body is ready. 
WARDEN:  Okay, sweet. Let’s roll. 
CLEO:  Fail. 
KNOX:  Fail. 
PHIL: Y’all. 
WARDEN:  Okay, so, Cleo, you fire but the 
creature is moving too fast. Y ou hit the pipes 
embedded in the bulkhead, and they spray 
steam right into your eyes. Take 4 Damage. 
CLEO:  Dammit!
WARDEN:  Knox, the Phil-Thing snatches you 
up, and its claws just tear through you. Y ou 
take... ouch. 14 Damage—
KNOX:  That’s a Wound for sure. 
WARDEN:  Alright, Cpl. Davis, you arrive and 
you’re seeing this carnage. Y our former 
character is about to devour Knox alive. 
What’s everyone doing? Oh, and Knox, let’s 
roll up that Wound.
KNOX:  Wonderful.
Being Effective in a Fight
Y our Combat Stat isn’t the only thing that 
matters when it comes to fighting for your 
life. Distract enemies while your fellow 
crewmembers take aim. Study the creature’s 
movement to see if you can spot a pattern or 
weakness. Bandage bleeding wounds. Run 
away (always a good idea). Hide. In short, 
treat every round like a completely unique 
situation, and try not to look at your character 
sheet too much. Outsmart, outrun, and 
outlast your enemy. That’s all that matters.27.1 WHAT CAN I DO?
Characters can generally move somewhere within 
Close Range  and then do one thing before the 
situation changes.
Think of the situation like a real life scenario. Think 
about what you would do in those circumstances, 
then describe that to the Warden. If you can’t 
accomplish everything you want to do in one 
round, or your choices are especially foolhardy or 
dangerous, the Warden will do their best to let you 
know and explain the risks involved. 
Here’s a non-exhaustive list of the kinds of things 
you could attempt in a round:
• Attack something or someone.
• Bandage a wound to try and stop the bleeding.
• Check vital signs with a medscanner.
• Move again.
• Fire a vehicle’s weapon.
• Maneuver or pilot a vehicle.
• Open an airlock.
• Operate a machine.
• Reload a weapon.
• Throw something at or to someone.
• Use a computer terminal (to search a directory, 
engage automatic airlocks, send a distress 
signal, cycle through CCTV cameras, disable 
Life Support, etc.).
Additionally, if you decide to do nothing other 
than run, you can move somewhere within Long 
Range during the round.

WHAT CAN I DO?
COVER
TYPE AP
INSIGNIFICANT COVER 
Wood furniture/doors, body shields, etc. AP: 5
LIGHT COVER 
Trees, bulkhead walls, metal furniture, etc.AP: 10
HEAVY COVER 
Airlock doors, cement beams, ships, etc.DR: 5 AP: 2028.1 HOW DO I ATTACK?
Make a Combat Check. If successful, roll the weapon’s 
Damage and subtract it from the enemy’s Health. If 
y
ou fail, the situation gets worse and you gain 1 Stress.
Read about Stat Checks on pg. 18.
28.2 DAMAGE
When taking Damage (DMG), subtract it from 
Health. If your Health reaches zero, gain a Wound  
and roll on the Wounds Table. Then, reset the 
character’s Health to its Maximum and subtract any 
carr
yover damage. Once your character suffers their 
Maximum Wounds, make a Death Save.
Read about Death on pg. 29.2. 
28.3 ARMOR
Characters ignore all Damage less than their 
armor’s Armor Points (AP). However, if they ever 
take Damage greater than or equal to their AP in 
one hit, their ar
mor is destroyed and they suffer any 
remaining Damage. Weapons with Anti-Armor (AA)
ignore and destroy armor whenever they hit. Some 
armor may have Damage Reduction (DR) which always 
reduces incoming Damage by the amount stated (even if 
the ar
mor is destroyed, or if the weapon has Anti-Armor). 
Damage Reduction occurs first (before any Armor).
28.4 COVER
The environment can provide protection called Cover. 
It can be destroyed, just like armor, whenever it is dealt 
Damage g
reater than or equal to its AP . Cover typically 
only protects against ranged attacks, but in some 
situations may help block a hand-to-hand attack. If you 
shoot while in Cover, you are considered out of Cover 
until y
our next turn.28

DEATH
D10 RESULT
00You are unconscious.  You wake up in 2d10 minutes. 
Reduce your Maximum Health by 1d5.
01-02You are unconscious and dying.  You die in 1d5 
rounds without intervention.
03-04You are comatose.  Only extraordinary measures can 
return you to the waking world.
05-09 You have died.  Roll up a new character.29.2 DEATH
If your death seems imminent, make your last 
moments count: save someone’s life, solve an 
important mystery, give the others time to escape. 
When you die, the Warden makes a Death Save  
by placing 1d10 in a cup, shaking the cup, and 
placing it face down on the table (covering the die). 
As soon as someone spends a turn checking your 
vitals, the die is revealed and the roll is looked up 
on the Death Table  below. Use common sense.

When gaining a Wound, roll 1d10 on the Wounds 
Table  according to the type of Damage:
• Blunt Force:  Getting punched, hit with a 
crowbar or a thrown object, falling, etc.
• Bleeding:  Getting stabbed or cut.
• Gunshot: Getting shot by a firearm.
• Fire & Explosives:  Grenades, flamethrowers, 
doused in fuel and lit on fire, etc.
• Gore & Massive:  Giant or gruesome attacks.
Use the Severity  column (and common 
sense) as a guide. Flesh Wounds  are small 
inconveniences. Minor/Major Injuries  
cause lasting issues which require medical 
treatment. Lethal Injuries  can kill you if not 
dealt with immediately. Fatal Injuries  can kill 
outright. Bleeding wounds, if not treated can 
quickly overwhelm you. Some attacks deal 
Wounds directly (bypassing any Armor or 
Damage Reduction).

WARDEN:  Alright, so the 
airlock door breaks down 
and more of these Phils 
start swarming the base.
KNOX:  I’m running. Just 
pure running, non-stop.
Cleo: I’m going to lob a 
grenade before running.
WARDEN:  It’s within Close 
Range. Y ou’re throwing it or 
just dropping it?
CLEO:  Just dropping.
WARDEN:  In that case it 
makes sense to give them 
an Instinct Save to avoid.IT CAN TOUCH YOU
30.1 ADJACENT
Y ou’re basically touching. This 
covers fist fights, close-quarters 
combat, and trying to get out of 
the grips of a hideous terror’s 
claws. More than that, it covers 
things like using a computer 
terminal or administering first 
aid to someone. Y ou can talk 
comfortably, whisper, and even 
smell someone at this range.Range, distance, and movement 
are tracked abstractly in Range 
Bands . These are:
• Adjacent
• Close Range
• Long Range
• Extreme Range
Describing distance should be 
done in human casual terms. 
What’s important is whether 
someone can touch you, 
whether they can get to you, 
whether you can shoot them, or 
whether you can’t.30
RANGE & DISTANCE

31.3 EXTREME RANGE
Only the longest range 
weapons, like smart rifles, can 
hit something accurately in this 
band. It takes more than one 
turn to get to something here, 
and even if you hear a scream 
you might not know which 
direction it’s coming from.YOU CAN SHOOT IT
31.2 LONG RANGE
Things in this band are far 
enough away that they take an 
entire round or longer to get to. 
Rifles are effective at this range, 
but handguns and shotguns 
less so. Y ou’d have to yell at 
someone to get their attention, 
and you probably won’t smell 
anyone at Long Range, no 
matter how bad they stink.IT CAN GET TO YOU
31.1 CLOSE RANGE
Someone Close can be reached 
by running over to them in a 
few seconds. They’re near 
enough that you could likely 
throw something at them and 
hit them. Y ou’d have to speak 
loud enough that someone on 
the other side of the room could 
hear you. Powerful stenches 
can be smelled if they’re Close. 
Firearms like shotguns are 
most effective at this range or 
Adjacent.31
RANGE & DISTANCE
32.4 EXHAUSTION
Long grueling treks on undiscovered planets 
can easily grind you down. If it becomes relevant, 
track exhaustion by making a Body Save every 
hour after 12 hours of activity. On failure gain 1 
Stress and take 1 Damage. After 24 hours of 
exhaustion, roll at Disadvantage on all rolls 
until the character can rest for 8 hours.
32.5 FOOD & WATER
Humans can survive roughly 3 weeks without 
food. After 24 hours without food, roll at 
Disadvantage to all rolls.
For the bare minimum of 
survival you need 1 liter 
of water a day. However, 
at this level, any 
strenuous activity 
(e.g., running, combat, 
making mechanical 
repairs) forces you to 
make a Body Save or 
pass out. When water 
is scarce and you’re 
tracking it this closely, 
you’re at Disadvantage 
on all rolls.Below are some of the most common afflictions 
characters may encounter while exploring space.
32.1 ATMOSPHERES
Planets with Toxic or Corrosive atmospheres 
require special gear to explore, otherwise there is 
the risk of harm or even death. 
Toxic Atmosphere
The planet’s atmosphere is not fit to breathe, but 
is otherwise safe. A rebreather or armor with its 
own oxygen supply is required. Without these, 
characters take 1d10 DMG per round, Body 
Save for half.
Corrosive Atmosphere
The planet’s atmosphere is deadly and destructive. 
It deals Damage every round while on it. This 
ranges from 1 DMG / round (Mildly Corrosive) 
to 10 DMG / round (Highly Corrosive).  Anything 
higher is simply impossible to safely traverse 
without specialized equipment and armor. 
32.2 BLEEDING
Some weapons or Wounds cause characters to 
Bleed.  This means they take 1 Damage every 
round until the bleeding is stopped.  This is 
cumulative. If a character is bleeding 1 Damage 
per round and gains Bleeding +1,  they now take 
2 Damage per round. Bleeding damage ignores 
armor and damage reduction.
Read more about Violent Encounters on pg. 26.
32.3 CRYOSICKNESS
To endure long space journeys or hyperspace 
jumps, crews use cryopods, which are coffin-
like capsules that freeze them in a suspended 
animation called cryosleep. While in cryosleep, 
vitals are preserved and aging slows down. 
However, upon awakening, you experience a 
hangover-like feeling called cryosickness, which 
causes sluggishness and slow reflexes. While 
cryosick you suffer [-] on all rolls for 1 week.  
Upgraded cryochambers can help mitigate these 
effects, and a stimpak can cure them instantly.

Shipbreaker’s Toolkit on pg. 30.32
SURVIVAL
RADIATION
LEVEL DAMAGE
LEVEL 1 - TRACE  
Normal, everyday radiation, 
cosmic rays.None immediately. Possible long-
term side effects (cancer, etc.).
LEVEL 2 - ACUTE  
Unshielded reactors/Warp Cores.Reduce all Stats and Saves by 1 
every round.
LEVEL 3 - LETHAL  
Atomic weapons, direct handling 
of Warp Cores.Every round: Body Save or lethal 
dose (death in 1d5 days).33.2 RADIATION
Whether it’s cosmic rays, an engine leak, or some 
previously undiscovered asteroid ore, radiation 
can kill you if you’re not careful.
Armor with Radiation Shielding  (e.g., the Hazard 
Suit) blocks all three levels of radiation.
Read about Armor on pg. 14-15  and pg. 28.3.
33.3 STIMPAK OVERDOSE
Excessive use of stimpaks (and other dangerous 
drugs) carries a risk of overdose. Whenever a 
character takes more than one stimpak in a day, 
roll 1d10. If you roll under the amount of doses 
taken in the past 24 hours, make a Death Save. 
Read more about Death Saves on pg. 29.2
33.4 TEMPERATURE
In most cases, a hot climate or a cold climate has 
no notable effects. However, in places of extreme 
cold or heat, you should make Body Saves every 
hour or succumb to the Extreme Cold/Heat.
Extreme Cold
In sub-zero temperatures hypothermia and 
frostbite can set in within 10-30 min for those 
not dressed appropriately. To survive you must 
bring your body up to its normal temperature. 
Hypothermia can kill within 30 min to 6 hours.
Extreme Heat
Extreme heat over 100ºF/40ºC can cause heat 
stroke and kill within hours. Victims must move 
to a cooler location immediately to get their 
temperature down.33.1 OXYGEN
In space you can last 15 seconds without oxygen 
before falling unconscious. After passing out, you 
can survive for 1d5 minutes before dying.
If all of a ship’s Life Support System goes offline, 
roll 1d10 and multiply it by the maximum crew 
capacity. This is the remaining oxygen supply.
Every 24 hours, subtract the total number of 
breathing crewmembers from the remaining 
oxygen supply.  Any crewmembers engaging 
in strenuous activity (e.g., running, combat, 
mechanical repairs, etc.) further reduce the 
oxygen supply by 2 each.
Whenever the oxygen supply is less 
than twice the amount of breathing 
passengers,  all rolls are at 
Disadvantage as the crew suffers 
headaches, fatigue, anxiety, and 
general clumsiness.
Whenever the oxygen supply 
is less than the total amount 
of breathing passengers,  every 
breathing passenger must 
make a Body Save or 
else make a Death Save 
(pg. 29.2) as they suffer 
panting, dizziness, severe 
headaches, impaired vision 
and tinnitus.
Once the oxygen supply 
runs out,  you can survive 
for 15 seconds before you 
fall unconscious. After 
falling unconscious,  
you can survive for 
1d5 minutes without 
oxygen before dying.
Androids do not 
consume oxygen from 
the oxygen supply
Those in cryosleep do not 
reduce the Oxygen supply.33
SURVIVAL
Example: Recovery
WARDEN : Congratulations! Y ou make it back 
to port safe and sound, except for Jamie.
PHIL: Rest in peace, you son of a bitch.
WARDEN : Corporate is sending a shuttle 
for you, but it won’t be here for a couple of 
weeks. Is there anything ya’ll want to do 
while you’re waiting? This is a B-Class Port, 
so they have a decent amount of amenities.
CLEO : Y eah, I want to treat this Paranoid 
condition I’ve got. Is there somewhere I can 
go for that?
WARDEN : Let’s see, there’s a Cognitive 
Defragging clinic. It costs about 100k credits 
for a 24 hour long surgery. There is however 
a slight 1% chance of total amnesia.
CLEO : I don’t have that kind of money even if 
I was okay with losing all of my memories.
PHIL: We have that goo jar we could sell.
KNOX : What about Wounds? I’m hanging on 
by a thread here.
WARDEN : Pseudoflesh Injections run about 
500kcr a pop.
PHIL: Maybe we should just die, it would be 
cheaper.
WARDEN : Well, if you need cash quick, there’s 
a little job you could do...
No matter how careful you are, sooner or later you 
are going to get hurt. Minor injuries can usually 
be treated with a quick rest, but Wounds and 
Conditions require professional treatment.
34.1 SHORT TERM RECOVERY
Once per day, whenever resting, a character’s 
body attempts to heal itself naturally. After 6+ 
hours of rest make a Body Save. If successful, 
reset Health to its Maximum.  Wounds, however, 
remain the same.
34.2 LONG TERM RECOVERY
Recovering Wounds, Conditions, or losses to 
Stats and Saves takes a longer time. See the 
Medical Expenses table for a non-comprehensive 
list of available treatments.34
